<p><strong>Doubling down on DFW: American further strengthens its Flagship
hub</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A reimagined schedule at the airline’s largest and most important hub
  enhances the customer experience at nearly every touchpoint.</li>

  <li>Adjustments to scheduled flight times drive greater certainty for
  customers, improved and more desirable departure times and more seamless
  journeys.</li>

  <li>Schedule enhancements and ongoing investments continue to improve the
  overall airport experience.</li>

  <li>American’s track record of recovering from irregular operations better
  than any other airline is further bolstered with investments in remote
  deplaning resources.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>FORT WORTH</strong> — American Airlines is fundamentally changing
the way it does business at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), the
airline’s largest hub, and the airline’s customers will soon benefit from those
changes in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>DFW has an outsized impact on the rest of the airline’s operation and on the
journeys of the nearly 700,000 customers the airline serves every day across
its global network. More customers and more bags travel and connect through DFW
every day than any other airport in American’s network — with more than 30% of
all daily connecting customers and daily connecting checked bags traveling
through the airline’s hometown airport. When DFW runs well, American runs well.
That impact demands continued focus and investment, and both are already well
underway. The airline is investing millions of dollars to fortify DFW,
delivering:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Smoother, seamless</strong> airport experiences</li>

  <li><strong>Greater certainty</strong> to schedules and connections</li>

  <li><strong>Improved resilience</strong> when weather or other disruptions
  hit</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Restructuring DFW today for the customer journeys of
tomorrow</strong>
</p>

<p>For more than a decade, American’s schedule at DFW has been concentrated
across nine banks, or large clusters of flights across the operating day. As
all airline bank structures do, this times large groups of flights together,
coordinating arrivals and departures, and ultimately, coordinating quick and
seamless connections.</p>

<p>Beginning in April — and visible in the airline’s schedules starting Dec. 27
— American’s DFW operation is evolving to a 13-bank structure, providing more
certainty to the airline’s average 100,000 peak daily customers traveling on
the more than 930 average peak DFW daily departing flights.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  <p>“As the operating environment and our customers’ expectations have evolved
  in the last 10 years, our approach at our largest and most impactful hub must
  also evolve,” said Jim Moses, Senior Vice President of DFW Operations. “We’re
  making this significant shift while maintaining the same breadth, depth and
  schedule quality our customers expect and depend on. That means good things
  for American’s customers, our team members and just about everyone who
  depends on the airline.”</p>
</div>

<p>With this structural schedule change, customers will also benefit from more
improved early-morning departure times compared to 2025. Specifically, they
will experience more departure options in highly desired time windows and fewer
early morning departures to DFW, which is especially good news for customers
making morning connections through DFW.</p>

<h3>Adding even more trip certainty</h3>

<p>In addition to the airline’s DFW schedule, American is making a bold and
unprecedented investment in block time for flights to and from DFW and across
the airline’s network. Block time — the total scheduled time between pushback
from the departure gate to arrival at the destination gate — determines how
long a customer’s trip feels.</p>

<p>With this investment in American’s customers, the airline is ensuring more
on-time departures that lead to more on-time arrivals and fewer delays, all
creating an overall smoother and improved travel experience. In short, American
is bolstering its ability to get its customers and their bags where they’re
going and on time.</p>

<h3>Maximizing connections, minimizing disruptions</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Improved customer connection times:</strong> American is making
  it easier to connect through DFW. While customers will still have the
  flexibility to book tight connections when time matters —especially for
  business travelers — the schedule enhancements provide more options for a
  stress-free experience. American’s new structure at DFW reduces the
  concentration of very short connection times, creating more balance that
  offers customers greater confidence when planning their journey.</li>

  <li><strong>More connection opportunities:</strong> The new bank structure
  keeps nearly all existing connection opportunities in addition to creating
  new opportunities across the airline’s most-connected hub airport.</li>

  <li><strong>It’s great for bags, too:</strong> Just as customer connections
  will improve, so, too, will checked bag connections. That means even more
  bags arriving with customers, and in many cases, arriving ahead of customers.
  American has doubled down on checked bag management over the past few years,
  and this fundamental shift at DFW further strengthens the work already being
  experienced by customers.</li>

  <li><strong>Airspace efficiency:</strong> What’s good on the ground is also
  good in the air. By reflowing American’s DFW schedule, the airline is helping
  make the airspace around the DFW metroplex even more efficient, meaning fewer
  air traffic delays and more on-time departures and arrivals for
  customers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Improving the overall airport experience</h3>

<p>As American spreads out its DFW flight schedule across the day, the airline
is also spreading out customer volume, including everything from local
customers arriving in parking garages, checking in at lobbies and clearing
security to connecting customers making their way through American’s terminals
to their next flights.</p>

<p>These changes are on top of a number of other critical investments to
further enhance the customer experience when traveling through American’s
Flagship hub, and importantly, enabling future growth, which means more flight
and destination options for our customers. That includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Modernizing American’s facilities and airport terminals, including
  Terminal A and C Pier extensions adding nine incremental gates.</li>

  <li>Expanding American’s DFW footprint with the <a href=
  "https://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2025/American-Airlines-and-DFW-Airport-reveal-plans-for-state-of-the-art-new-terminal-for-customers-OPS-INF-05/default.aspx">
    addition of Terminal F</a>. When completed in 2030, the airline will
    operate all 31 new gates in the terminal with increased widebody capacity,
    state of the art baggage technology and dedicated premium lounges, Flagship
    check-in and a new U.S. Customs facility.
  </li>

  <li>Streamlining the airport security experience through new and innovative
  programs in partnership with the Transportation Security Administration and
  U.S. Customs and Border Protection. TSA PreCheck Touchless ID is allowing
  customers at DFW (and 17 other locations across American’s broad U.S.
  network) to use facial recognition technology for more secure and efficient
  identity verification. And with Enhanced Passenger Processing and One Stop
  Security — of which, <a href=
  "https://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2025/Cool-calm-and-connected-American-Airlines-becomes-first-airline-to-pilot-One-Stop-Security-in-the-US-OPS-OTH-07/">
    American was the first U.S. airline to roll out</a> — customers arriving
    into and connecting through DFW from international travel are experiencing
    record fast U.S. immigration processing times along with a much-improved
    connection to their next flight.
  </li>

  <li>Reimagining traffic flow, in coordination with DFW Airport, to provide a
  seamless travel experience pre- and post-flight. Critical updates to the
  vehicle traffic flow went live right ahead of the winter holiday travel
  season.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recovering even better when bad weather hits</h3>

<p>No other airline recovers from bad weather and irregular operations better
than American, and the airline has demonstrated that time and time again.
Having the airline’s largest hub at DFW provides immeasurable benefits to
American’s customers and the broader airline, including the ability to easily
connect through an airport centrally located in the U.S.</p>

<p>With all the benefits DFW brings, it has also recently experienced a
disproportionate amount of bad weather, particularly thunderstorms that can
require the entire airport to be paused until the conditions clear. When that
happens in the future, this new schedule structure will provide far greater
resilience and less adverse impact, allowing American to recover even quicker
and get customers on their way as soon as the weather clears.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  <p>“Our investment in operational resilience extends beyond our DFW
  schedule,” said Moses. “We know the negative impact flight diversions have on
  our customers. They’re also incredibly disruptive to the broader airline,
  especially as they create congestion at airports which often limits our
  ability to get aircraft to a gate and importantly, deplane customers.”</p>
</div>

<p>At DFW, American is investing millions of dollars in additional remote
deplaning capability (everything from equipment and bussing to staffing) that
allows the airline to most importantly, divert fewer flights away from DFW.</p>
