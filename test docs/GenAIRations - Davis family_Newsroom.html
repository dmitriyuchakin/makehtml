<h3><strong>GenAIRations: How one family honors decades of friendship and
legacy</strong>
</h3>

<div class="blockquote">
  On a brutally cold morning in 1989, Anthony “Tony” Davis hopped onto the
  American Airlines employee bus to make his way to Dallas Fort Worth
  International Airport. A spry young pilot, he smiled and greeted everyone
  onboard with a cheerful “Good morning!”
</div>

<p>But it hadn’t been the best morning for Flight Attendant Susan Forrest.
Susan, who joined American in 1987, had trouble getting to work because of the
frigid weather, and she woke up early to scrape the ice off her car and fill up
her tank before parking and catching the same bus. But Tony’s happy 5 a.m.
spirit caught her eye.</p>

<p>They ran into each other sometime later at a jazz concert in Arlington,
Texas, and were formally introduced by a mutual friend. They went out to eat
after the concert, and Tony wrote his name and phone number on a tortilla.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  “He folded it up and gave it to me, and he said, ‘I’m going to give this to
  you just in case, but If I call you in 10 days, will you go out with me?’”
  Susan says. “I laughed and thought to myself, ‘Ten days? That’s quite a
  line!”
</div>

<p>Susan Forrest became Susan Davis in 1991. Over the next three decades, the
couple welcomed two sons, Drew and Evan, and celebrated dozens of milestones
throughout their careers at American — in very good company. Tony’s childhood
best friend and recently retired pilot, Robert “Bob” Mortenson, and Tony’s
sister, Flight Attendant Michelle McDonogh, were also part of the American
team. And soon, Drew, Tony and Susan’s eldest son and Cadet Academy graduate,
will embark on a new journey as a cadet with Envoy, a wholly owned regional of
American.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  “Blessed is the word that comes to mind,” Tony says of his 37-year career.
  “So incredibly blessed, and a lot of good luck in there, too.”
</div>

<p><strong>Tony’s career at American</strong>
</p>

<p>Tony and Bob grew up together, with Tony’s father being a Navy pilot in
World War II and the Korean War, and Bob’s as a pilot in the Air Force during
the Vietnam War era. Bob’s father was instrumental in Tony’s decision to pursue
aviation, mentoring the young men throughout their college years to join the
Air Force.</p>

<p>Tony ended up with a slot at the airlift squadron at Travis Air Force Base
flying cargo while Bob got a fighter slot. A few years later, they were both
hired at American. Tony flew back to California every few weeks to fulfill his
Air Force duties until about 1993.</p>

<p>Tony's sister Michelle “saw how much fun they were having” and joined
American as a flight attendant in 1995. She was initially based in California
before getting married and transferring to Chicago. With Susan, the quartet
spent decades together, flying together and meeting up on distant layovers
whenever possible. Some of Tony’s favorite memories include family trips to
Australia and New Zealand, taking his boys on layovers occasionally and a
flight to London with Susan for her birthday.</p>

<p>Between Susan and Tony, working together also meant they could care for
their sons in ways those working a traditional work schedule couldn’t. With
various weekdays off and the ability to trade around shifts, one parent was
always around for the boys.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  “I wouldn’t have been able to see all their games, graduations and piano
  recitals,” Susan says. “I’m most appreciative of the flexibility."
</div>

<p>In his 37-year career, Tony spent thousands of hours flying, but some
flights are more memorable than others. In September 2021, Tony had the honor
of bringing home the remains of Fr. Emil Kapaun from Honolulu to his family in
Wichita, Kansas. Fr. Kapaun was a Captain and Chaplain in the U. S. Army during
the Korean War. He died in a prisoner of war camp, was posthumously awarded the
Medal of Honor and is currently being considered for Sainthood.</p>

<p>During that layover in Honolulu before the return flight, Tony went to the
National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, completely unaware of where Fr.
Kapaun’s remains were kept.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  “I just wanted to get a feel for where he was,” Tony says. “Miraculously, I
  walked up, turned right, looked up at the wall, and I was standing in front
  of his very resting spot at the time.”
</div>

<p>Perhaps the most memorable flights were Tony’s retirement flights in
mid-July 2025 between Honolulu and Dallas-Fort Worth. There was certainly
precious cargo onboard, including Susan, Drew, Evan, two of Tony’s sisters —
including Michelle — and a brother-in-law. Bob wasn’t on the flight, but he
made it to the gate for the send-off.</p>

<p>The crew, all of whom knew Tony, all bid to work the flight together so they
could make the journey as special as possible.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  “I was surrounded by family, friends and colleagues from American Airlines
  who all expressed in the sincerest ways their appreciation for my years of
  service, and they all bode me well-wishes for my years ahead,” he says. “I
  soaked in every minute.”
</div>

<p><strong>Continuing the aviation legacy</strong>
</p>

<p>His dad was certainly an inspiration, but Drew says he felt his own pull
toward the industry. After he flew his first solo flight, there was a
shift.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  “Immediately after I took off, I came back in and landed the plane for the
  first time. I was taxiing back on the tarmac, I just kind of burst into
  tears. It was an overwhelming emotion,” Drew says. “I felt connected through
  the generations — to my dad and to my grandfather. That was a really nice
  moment when I knew that this was the path that was right for me.”
</div>

<p>Drew became a cadet at the Cadet Academy in June 2022, and he was recently
accepted to be an Envoy Cadet. Once he reaches his required flight hours, he’ll
start his formal training as a first officer for Envoy.</p>

<p>One day, Drew hopes to become a commercial pilot, like his dad, hopefully at
American. He’s also hoping for the same journey his parents had: One filled
with a lot of gratitude.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  “Luck probably follows people with great attitudes and people who have love
  and kindness in their hearts,” Drew says. “And I think both my parents have
  that.”
