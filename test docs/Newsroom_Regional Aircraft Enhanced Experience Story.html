<p><strong>Elevating the experience: American Airlines brings mainline comfort
to regional flights</strong>
</p>

<p>With the largest regional fleet of any U.S. carrier, American Airlines is
redefining what travelers can expect from short-haul flights. American is
investing in the details that matter most to customers by transforming the
onboard experience on its regional aircraft to better match its mainline
aircraft.</p>

<p>As part of a phased rollout beginning this fall, customers will start seeing
refreshed regional aircraft interiors paired with fast Wi-Fi and power at every
seat. These modern touches will ensure that every flight — no matter the
distance — delivers the comfort, consistency and connectivity customers
deserve.</p>

<h3>Staying connected with fast, reliable Wi-Fi</h3>

<p>American currently has high-speed gate-to-gate satellite Wi-Fi on nearly 300
regional aircraft, which will expand to the full dual-class regional fleet by
early 2026 — more than any other airline — as it introduces complimentary Wi-Fi
for AAdvantage<sup>®</sup> members in January.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  <p>“Our customers value staying connected in the air, even on a relatively
  short flight,” said Heather Garboden, American’s Chief Customer Officer.
  “We’ve been working diligently to ensure our regional fleet offers the best
  and most reliable high-speed connectivity, especially as we look ahead to
  free Wi-Fi in 2026.”</p>

<h3>A fresh interior with seats designed for comfort</h3>

<p>When customers step on board the newly delivered Embraer 175 and Bombardier
CRJ900 aircraft, they’ll notice the difference immediately. The clean, modern
cabin design features updated seat coverings that mirror the look and feel of
the mainline fleet, because consistency matters when customers are on the move.
In addition to the refreshed look, the aircraft include in-seat power so
customers can keep their phones, tablets or laptops charged and ready from
takeoff to landing.</p>

<p>American plans to roll out the new regional interior by retrofitting all the
CRJ700, CRJ900, E170 and E175 aircraft operated by its regional carriers. The
aircraft retrofits are expected to be completed over the coming years.</p>

<h3>Creating a consistent customer experience</h3>

<p>American has streamlined its onboard snack offerings to create a more
consistent experience across both mainline and regional flights. Customers in
the premium cabin on regional flights can now enjoy a midday snack basket to
complement the morning and evening snack baskets, ensuring uniform service
throughout the network.</p>

<p>Additionally, AAdvantage<sup>®</sup> members can now redeem
AAdvantage<sup>®</sup> miles for inflight purchases on all flights, making it
even easier to enjoy onboard offerings while maximizing loyalty rewards.</p>

<p><strong>Overhead bins that make sense for your carry-on bags</strong>
</p>

<p>For customers who prefer to carry on a rollaboard suitcase, American is
working with Embraer on developing and designing larger overhead bins for our
larger regional aircraft. The airline anticipates rolling out the aircraft with
larger overhead bins in the coming years, creating more room for bags and
making boarding smoother for our customers flying on regional aircraft.</p>
