<p>As we close out Military Appreciation Month, here’s a behind-the-scenes look
at one of the ways American honors our veterans and those who are still serving
in the military.</p>
<p><strong>Operation capture Medal of Honor assets</strong></p>
<p>Flagship Valor was unveiled March 25, 2022, to coincide with the
groundbreaking of the <a href="https://mohmuseum.org/" target="_blank">National
Medal of Honor Museum</a> in Arlington, Texas. Most of the time, Flagship Valor
is in regularly scheduled service, but it’s also used for special Military and
Veterans Initiatives (MVI) missions, and it’s highly requested for Honor
Flights at hubs around the country.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
  <p>“This special livery is an extension of our support to great organizations
  like the Medal of Honor Foundation, the Woody Williams Foundation and the
  National Medal of Honor Museum that recently opened, among many others,”
  explained <a href=
  "https://jetnet.aa.com/userprofile/105251/501162-corpaa-aa-com">Randy
  Stillinger</a>, Manager of Military and Veterans Initiatives at American.
  “American has a long history of supporting those who serve in the military,
  and Flagship Valor recognizes the sacrifices that they’ve made.”</p>

<p>However, creating the Flagship Valor livery was an ambitious task.</p>
<p>Early in the design process in April 2021, it became clear the centerpiece
of the Flagship Valor livery would be the Medals of Honor. Randy and Van
Urfalian, Creative Director at TNYCP Creative, quickly reached out to the
Congressional Medal of Honor Society for photos of the medals, but the
resolution wasn’t high enough for large-scale printing.</p>

is also awarded to Marines and Coast Guard members, and the Air Force Medal of
Honor (right). (Photo courtesy of Van Urfalian, Creative Director, TNYCP

<p>To do the medals justice, they needed to be professionally photographed in
incredibly fine detail. The team packed their gear and traveled to Patriots
Point, Mount Pleasant, S.C. They were surprised to find themselves walking up
the gangway to the U.S.S. Yorktown, the decommissioned aircraft carrier turned
museum. The medals were stored aboard the massive ship where the Congressional
Medal of Honor Society also has an office.</p>

<p>Before the trip, Roger Steele, Base Maintenance Supervisor at Tech Ops –
Tulsa, provided a crucial piece of the puzzle: a section of aircraft paneling
painted <a href=

Silver Eagle gray</a>. It was the same surface the final images would be
applied to, ensuring the photographs would look as real as possible. One by
one, the three distinct medals were photographed in high definition. Each shot
was painstakingly arranged, capturing the weight of history in every frame.</p>

<p>When the final images were applied to the aircraft and Flagship Valor made
its debut 18 months later on March 25, 2022, there was no mistaking it: the
medals looked true to life, down to every last detail.</p>
<p>In addition to the pristine images of the three Medals of Honor, the
aircraft also spells out the six characteristics that embody the Medal of Honor
and those who have received it. Below that are a series of blue silhouettes
that depict the seven major military conflicts since Abraham Lincoln created
the medal in 1861 — from the Civil War to the Global War on Terrorism. This
part of the livery pays tribute to all who have served, not just those who wear
the medal.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
  <p>“We tried hard to keep this project a secret, even to the extent that we
  flew it home under the cover of darkness and snuck it into Hangar 5 at DFW
  the night before the dedication,” Randy said. “With all the aircraft spotters
  around the system, we had some people wondering and speculating on social
  media, but we were able to keep the unveiling a surprise.”</p>

<p><em>Picture caption: The Flagship Valor livery is a combination of paint and
custom wrap. It features 13 stars, symbolizing the original 13 colonies of the
United States, and the light blue color throughout the design is the symbolic
color for valor.</em></p>
<p><em>Picture caption: Interior signage and QR codes were installed on the
overhead bins to give our passengers an opportunity to learn more about the
Medal of Honor and our support for the recipients.</em></p>
