<h3>Jacs Wyatt highlights power of leadership at top industry summit</h3>

<p>Some of the brightest minds in marketing strategy gathered recently at
<em>The Star</em> in Frisco, Texas — home of the Dallas Cowboys — for the Brand
Innovators Sports, Media and Entertainment Summit. The event brought together
global leaders like Nike, PepsiCo, Amazon and Google alongside emerging
disruptors. For American, it was a chance to connect with pioneers across
industries and think differently about how to engage customers and lead
teams.</p>

<p>Representing American, <strong>Jacs Wyatt</strong>, Managing Director of
Global Marketing, stood out for more than the airline’s bold creative
campaigns. Her session offered a compelling take on leadership and resilience —
both in marketing and in people management.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  Wyatt structured her session around three iconic sports quotes, drawing from
  Jim Valvano, Vince Lombardi and Michael Jordan. “Don’t give up on yourself,
  and don’t give up on the power of connection,” she told a packed room,
  echoing Valvano. “Resilience isn’t about going it alone. It’s about believing
  in your value and knowing when to collaborate, when to listen and when to
  lead.”
</div>

<p>She shared how strong, intentional leadership unlocks better collaboration
across teams and disciplines, allowing bold ideas to take flight. She
spotlighted how American’s marketing organization is breaking new ground, not
just in storytelling and marketing innovation, but in how teams are empowered
and aligned.</p>

<p>Quoting Lombardi, she added, “If we chase perfection, we can catch
excellence.” Jacs encouraged leaders to act like business owners, embrace
challenges and course correct in real time — skills that are just as essential
in leading people as in launching campaigns.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  Her message resonates far beyond marketing teams. “I’ve failed over and over
  again, and that’s why I succeed,” she said, quoting Jordan. “Failure isn’t
  the opposite of success, it’s the foundation of it.”
