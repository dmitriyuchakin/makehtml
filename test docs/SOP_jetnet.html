<h3>Headline: Walking the walk: American’s Safety Operations Partners</h3>

<h3>Description: Meet two Safety Operations Partners (SOPs): Sarah Kassebaum
and Chaz Adams.</h3>

<h3>Topic: Safety</h3>

<p>During National Safety Month, we’re highlighting American’s Safety
Operations Partners (SOPs), a unique function of the Safety Team with a “boots
on the ground” approach.</p>

<p>The newly-created SOP structure embeds members of the Safety team in the
operation. They’re focused on collaborating with frontline team members on
safety best practices, identifying risks, conducting investigations, offering
solutions to challenges in the field and building and reinforcing a
safety-focused workplace. There are <a href=

22 SOPs spread across the U.S.</a>, supporting every hub, several Tech Ops
locations and international operations.</p>

<h3>Today, we introduce you to two SOPs: Sarah Kassebaum, Tech Ops – Tulsa, and
Chaz Adams, LAX.</h3>

<h3>SUBHED: Meet Sarah Kassebaum, SOP at Tech Ops – Tulsa</h3>

<p>Sarah Kassebaum started with American as a 19-year-old who took a night job
cleaning Tech Ops – Tulsa so she could go to school during the day. Almost 25
years later, Sarah is the SOP and a fixture of the safety culture at the
330-acre base, the largest commercial aviation maintenance base in the
world.</p>

<p><strong>PULL QUOTE:</strong> “I wasn’t looking for a career in safety — it
kind of found me — and I am so thankful it did,” Sarah said.</p>

<p>To help her colleagues see safety through a different lens, Sarah takes
everyday examples of observations at the base and shares them regularly at
leadership and townhall meetings to start honest conversations about safety.
The examples could be as simple as a water leak in the middle of a walkway — a
potential slip hazard — or as impactful as not wearing proper personal
protective equipment, which could lead to a life-altering injury.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  “When I share these pictures, it helps connect the dots for people about why
  safety needs to be at the forefront of everything we do, every single day,”
  she said. “It’s not about punishment — it’s about learning what we as a team,
  both leaders and floor members, can do better.”
</div>

<p>But she doesn’t just talk the talk. Sarah also takes regular walks through
the base with the base’s leadership to identify any areas of opportunity that
could make the workplace safer and be a visible, reliable presence.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  “Actions often change attitudes,” she said. “And showing our team that we are
  out there in the operation, identifying concerns, and helping fix them, no
  matter how big or small, adds to overall safety awareness and willingness to
  change.”
</div>

<h3>That’s no small feat, considering there are more than 5,000 team members
working at the base.</h3>

<p>“At the end of the day, the whole reason I do this job and care the way I do
is because I really want everyone who works here to be able to live the life
they want to live with their friends and family outside of the job.”</p>

<h3>SUBHED: Meet Chaz Adams, SOP at LAX</h3>

<p>If you ask Chaz Adams about his career in safety, he’ll tell you that it’s
been a team effort from day one.</p>

<p>“I attribute my eye for safety to being a middle child — learning from my
older and younger siblings,” he said with a laugh.</p>

<p>Second to his family, Chaz says it was the encouragement of several leaders
that led him to pursue a career in safety. In 2014, while working for another
airline at their Hub Control Center, Chaz would identify risks he saw on camera
and bring his concerns to his manager. That same manager gave Chaz a leadership
opportunity and made him a safety chair, helping to further amplify his passion
for safety.</p>

<p>“Going from being a bug in his ear to being given that opportunity to be a
part of a bigger outcome — that was really awesome,” Chaz said.</p>

<p>In 2021, Chaz started his career at American as a customer service manager
(CSM) and credits his then-leader, Faith Ikeda, with getting him involved in
safety at American.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  “She saw in me a passion for safety,” Chaz said. “She quickly gave me
  opportunities to get more exposure through training, TDYs (temporary duty),
  and collaborating with other teams to develop safety materials for airports.”
</div>

<p>Today, Chaz is a Safety Operations Partner (SOP) at LAX, a role he’s had for
just six months but one in which he feels right at home.</p>

<p><strong>PULL QUOTE:</strong> “We always have something we can learn and
share, and it feels like this [being an SOP] is where I belong.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  “At its foundation, [being an SOP is] all about establishing relationships,”
  Chaz said. “Then once those relationships are in place, we really have the
  opportunity to influence outcomes and build safety culture. That’s where the
  action is.”
</div>

<h3>His advice for team members who are interested in learning more about
safety?</h3>

"https://jetnet.aa.com/sites/safety-and-regulatory-compliance/SitePageModern/290371/safety-operations-partners">
connect with your SOP</a> to go for a walk or grab a cup of coffee. Even if you
don’t know where to start, we’re here to help.”</p>
