<h3>ROBERT & DAVID LETTER | Government reopening</h3>

<h3>A note from Robert and David: Thank you for your hard work</h3>

<p><em>In a message to team members, CEO Robert Isom and COO David Seymour give
thanks for looking after our customers during the government shutdown.</em>
</p>

<h3>Fellow team members,</h3>

<p>Our government has been shut down for the past six weeks, which has made for
an incredibly challenging time for our airline and the industry as a whole.
Most importantly, it was extremely disruptive to our customers. In the past
week, we saw a crescendo effect as air traffic control staffing shortages led
to massive and unpredictable amounts of delays and cancellations across the
industry — and that was on top of a series of FAA-mandated schedule reductions.
While we both have been in this industry for a long time, only a few other
events come to mind when we think about this level of disruption.</p>

<p>Thankfully, that chapter is now over. The government is reopened and the
shutdown is behind us. Our message to you is simple and yet cannot be
overstated: <strong>Thank you.</strong> Thank you for the long hours, the hard
work and the round-the-clock care you’ve shown to our customers and each other.
Times like these are never easy for anyone, and the care and compassion we’ve
shown for people on life’s journey in the past month — during incredibly
challenging times for our operation — truly makes us proud.</p>

<h3>Relentless support of our customers</h3>

<p>Throughout this long week of disruption, we took great care of our
customers, publishing a travel alert that allowed changes to their travel plans
across our network, regardless of impact. We methodically reduced our schedule
in a way that minimized impact on customers and crew members and maximized our
ability to reaccommodate customers. We were transparent, communicative and
supportive, and our customers noticed. Three of the four top net promoter score
(NPS) days of the year so far were during this period of disruption, proving
how we stepped up to the plate — proving no one manages through and recovers
from a disruptive event quite like American.</p>

<h3>The days ahead</h3>

<p>Reopening the government is a critical step forward, and we’re grateful to
our leaders in Washington, D.C., for coming together to make that happen. And
of course, we must thank federal aviation workers — including air traffic
controllers and TSA officers — for coming to work without a paycheck and
maintaining the safety and security of our nation’s aviation system. Next is
getting air traffic controllers and other federal aviation workers paid, and
then making sure the FAA is comfortable with staffing at its facilities. We’ll
always follow the FAA’s lead as it ensures the safety of the national airspace
system. When we get the green light, know this: American is ready.</p>

<p>In the meantime, air traffic control staffing has begun to stabilize over
the last day or so, and we’ve already seen that materialize in our operation.
What that means for our customers and team is fewer day-of delays and close-in
cancellations. It means predictability. Still, it may take a few days for fully
normal controller operations to resume, and we may need to continue to reduce
schedules to comply with the FAA‘s emergency order requirements. But we have
seen promising signs and are confident that because of our strategic planning
and work to minimize customer impacts throughout this period, we will recover
quickly and deliver a strong Thanksgiving operation. The millions of customers
who chose American to reconnect them with friends and families and get them to
the table deserve the certainty.</p>

<h3>And this year, there is a lot to be thankful for.</h3>

<h3>Thank you again for your hard work. Be safe.</h3>
