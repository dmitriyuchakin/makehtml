  <li><strong>Evacuation efforts:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>To help customers depart Jamaica ahead of the hurricane’s arrival, we operated an extra flight from MBJ to Miami (MIA) on Oct. 26 before the airport closed.</li>
      <li>On Oct.28, we focused on helping customers who want to depart Turks and Caicos ahead of the hurricane’s arrival. We have added one extra flight from PLS to MIA and have upgraded an existing flight to a larger aircraft to accommodate more customers.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Larger aircraft:</strong> AA1900 MIA-PLS-MIA was upgraded from a Boeing 737 to an Airbus A321.</li>
          <li><strong>Extra flight:</strong> The extra flight will operate as AA9601 MIA-PLS and AA9602 PLS-MIA.</li>
          <li><strong>Relief supplies:</strong> We’re sending relief supplies to PLS on regularly scheduled flights.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Capped airfares:</strong> American capped fares for all direct flights departing from airports covered by the travel alert.</li>
  <li><strong>Operational status:</strong> American has suspended operations at HOG, KIN, MBJ, OCJ, PLS and SCU due to airport closures and will start damage assessments and making plans to resume operations at airports in the region when it is safe to do so.</li>
  <li><strong>Community support:</strong> From now through Nov. 11, AAdvantage<sup>®</sup> members can earn 10 miles for every dollar donated to the <a href="https://www.redcross.org/donate/cm/americanairlines-pub.html/">American Red Cross</a> with a minimum $25 donation.
